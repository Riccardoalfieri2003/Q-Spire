The circuit analyzed for this smell is composed of these operations:
{get_operations(smell.circuit)}
        
The information needed to understand this smell are: 
- maximum number of parallel operations in the circuit, which in this specific circuit is: {smell.parallel_op};
- maximum number of operations on any single qubit in the circuit, which in this specific circuit is: {smell.lenght_op};
- maximum error in the gates of the used backed, which in this case is: {list(smell.error.values())[0]}
We have this smell if (1-error)^(parallel_op*lenght_op) is less than a certain threshold, which is {get_detector_option("LC", "threshold", fallback=0.5)}

There are many way for this smell to be "mitigated". These are the most important ones:

Circuit Simplification (Algebraic / Gate Identities):
Replace sequences of gates with equivalent but shorter ones (e.g., cancel consecutive X gates, merge rotations).
Exploit commutativity to reorder operations and cancel them.
Use basis change (e.g., converting RZ + H + RZ into fewer rotations).

Decomposition into Subcircuits:
If the circuit logically contains independent parts (acting on disjoint qubit sets), run them separately instead of in one large circuit.
This only works if the algorithm doesn't require later entanglement between the subsets â€” but when it does, it's trickier.

Hybrid Quantum-Classical Splitting:
Push part of the computation to classical pre/post-processing.
For example, replace long quantum arithmetic blocks with classical computation where possible.

Of course, understand which approach is the best for our circuit.
In this specific smell, you don't have to completely solve it if you can't, we have just to mitigate it. Obviously if solved the better.
